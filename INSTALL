			nls_string for PostgreSQL
		-----------------------------------------

This is the INSTALL file for the nls_string and nls_value collating
functions for the PostgreSQL database server.

------------------------
Installation using make:

Untar the distribution, cd to the distribution directory and run

  # make

If everything goes well, the C source is compiled and copied to the
server directory. You might need package like postgresql-devel if
you install PostgreSQL using some kind of package manager as the
server instalation itself might not have everything you need to do
the compilation.

Then, do

  # psql database_name < nls_string.sql

and the functions will be created in the selected database. You can
start collating and be happy.

---------------------
Installation by hand:

To install the functions by hand, you have to compile the nls_string.c
to a shared library first. Please, check your current PostgreSQL
documentation, or

  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/static/xfunc-c.html#DFUNC

for details about your platform. The command

  $ gcc -I/usr/include/pgsql/server -fPIC -shared -o nls_string.so nls_string.c

did the trick for me on a Linux machine. Please adjust the -I path
according to the path where you have PostgreSQL source code tree,
or where your PostgreSQL include files are stored (provided you do not
have the full PostgreSQL source). If you do not have the full sources
and installed PostgreSQL using some package manager (rpm, deb),
you might need package like postgresql-devel. On some systems,

  $ pg_config --includedir-server

might help you to determine location of the include fules of installed
PostgreSQL.

After you have compiled the shared library, copy the resulting
nls_string.so to a location close and dear to your heart.

Now, in an SQL client, you have to tell the database about the library
and about the functions. Run command

  create function nls_string(text, text) returns text as
	'/path/to/the/library/nls_string' language C ;
  create function nls_value(text, text) returns bytea as
	'/path/to/the/library/nls_string' language C ;

Adjust the path to the library to the actual location. Or use relative
path or path starting with string $libdir, if you've placed the shared
library to a well known location. Check your current PostgreSQL
documentation, or

  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/static/xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-C-DYNLOAD

for details.

After you have created the nls_string and nls_value functions, try it
using some selects with order by clauses. Enjoy and be happy that you
can sort your data in PostgreSQL using any locale you want, without
much hassle.
